same resource has the same URI. when we fetch users using a get request, we are requesting a specific URI (localhost:8080/users)
Different representations are possible as well.
	- For the same resource, you may have different representations of the response structure. 
		- Example, can have JSON or XML content type.
		- or in English, french...etc It is important to be able to expose in in different formats or lanaguges.
		- The consumer needs to be the one asking for a specific representation.
This is where content negotiation comes in to place.
- Example: Consumer can use "accept header", when sending a request they can send a request with a MIME type such as
application/xml, application/json...etc
- Accept-language header is another option, to receive the response in a specific langauge (en, fr...etc)

Consumer and service provider negotiate with each other, and discuss what kind of representation of the resource they want.

These are defined in the request headers.

With spring boot, it's very easy. Go to pom.xml and add your dependency.
