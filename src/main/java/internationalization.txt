Your REST API might have consumers from around the world. How do you customize it users around the world?
thats where internationalization comes into place. We abbreviate it to "i18n"

We make use a of HTTP request Header - Accept-Language to indicate natural language and locale that the consumer prefers
en for English
fr for French
etc

Look at the above header to send the appropriate language header.
