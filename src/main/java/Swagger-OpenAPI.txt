Your REST API consumers need to have a clear understanding of the following:
	- The resources that are available in your application
	- The request/response structure (Constraints/Validation)
	- Actions that can be performed
	
REST API Documentation(irrespective of programming language being used)
Use Swagger and Open API

Swagger provides tools for documentation. Defacto standard for documenting your rest api. Open API specification was created based on Swagger spec.
The Swagger specification became the open API specification and swagger tools are tools used to visiualize and consume your API.

OpenAPI is a standard language-agnostic interface to define your rest api. Earlier called swagger specification. Helps you to discover and understand
REST APIs.

Swagger UI helps you visualize and interact with your REST API. It provides a great UI around the open API specification and enables you
to play around with your rest api.

springdoc-openapi java library helps to automate the generation of API documentation for spring boot projects.
