After having built a REST API, and have a number of consumers making use of it. There could come a time where you would need to implement
a new feature or change in your rest api, and you want to do this without breaking your code or forcing your consumers to adapt to a new change.

You must version your REST API in this case. Keep the current version with current changes the same, and implement the new changes for the new version
and let consumers know of the changes that will take place when updating to the latest version. This way, consumers wont have to face new changes
and can update the version whenever they wish to.

Ways to version rest api:
	- URL: host:8080/v2/users compared to host:8080/v1/users
	- Request parameter: v1 = version 1...etc
	- header
	- media type
